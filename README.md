## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://next-event-alpha.vercel.app/)

This is a NextJs project called NextEvent, it's quite simple: you can select curtain event and see it's detail or you can browse all the events and filter special events by it's year and month.

All the data is dummy data because I want to focus on learning nextjs features.
